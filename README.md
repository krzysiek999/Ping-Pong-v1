# Ping-Pong-v1

This is a simple game which is suitable for as well 1 player as a 2 players.
I have created it to get acquainted with threads and animations in Java.

If the user choses 1-player mode, the second paddle will be driven by built-in mechanism, which lets user earn points after some, random amount of collisions. 
In the other case, this mechanism will stay disactivated.

Leftside player can move his paddle by clicking W and S, rightside - by UP and DOWN arrow.
Game lasts until 11 points.
